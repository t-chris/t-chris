Waterloo engineering student, probably a software engineer, hopefully a science fiction writer, but mostly tired all the time.

- 💻 Currently randomly clicking some buttons as a software engineer at Electronic Arts.
- 🔧 I just do, like, everything on Java, and backend stuff most of the time (Spring, Play). Unfortunately. 
- 📫 Contact me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/obturrent); hope you enjoy awful jokes and food pics.
