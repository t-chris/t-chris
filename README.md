### 🐒 Hey, I'm Chris.

A Waterloo computer engineering student, probably a software engineer, hopefully an sci-fi fantasy author.

- 💻 Currently randomly clicking some buttons as an intern at Snowflake, previously at Newfront (Typescript), Wish (Python), and Electronic Arts (Kotlin).
- 🔧 I just do, like, everything on Python/Java, and backend stuff most of the time (Spring, Play). Unfortunately. 
- 📫 Contact me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/obturrent). I talk about things.
