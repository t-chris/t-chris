### 🐒 Hey, I'm Chris.

Waterloo engineering student, probably a software engineer, hopefully an author, but mostly tired, all the time.

- 💻 Currently randomly clicking some buttons as a software engineer at Wish (GQL, Python).
- 🔧 I just do, like, everything on Java, and backend stuff most of the time (Spring, Play). Unfortunately. 
- 📫 Contact me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/obturrent). I talk about things.
